# Metaheuristics Course Codes

The codes presented in this repository were implemented for the
"Otimização Heurística" (Heuristic Optimization) course of the
Electrical Engineering Doctoral program of the State University of
Londrina. Although technically the course's name is Heuristic
Optimization, most of the algorithms implemented are in fact
metaheuristic.
